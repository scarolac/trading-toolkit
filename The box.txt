NR7 days bruh
//find high and low of a bar and subtract them, save as double bRange
//track the bRange over time, each bar that has a smaller bRange increment NR variable by 1.
//NRvar would have to be global to run each new bar

//maybe even stochastic pop scans


//How to count CV??
momentum: 1 for up, 0 for sideways, -1 for down //Tide bar for momentum
Oscillator: 1 for up, 0 for sideways, -1 for down //Force index pop
trend(line): Confirmed/suspect should not affect, up = 1, down -1, sideways = 0 
S/R level: depending on trend, if up, and within 1/3 of distance to support in relation to next resistance

//fuck theses bottom ones, they might just need check boxes and visual inspection
Fib levels: 23.6, 38.2, 50, 61.8, 76.4: check if hits one
