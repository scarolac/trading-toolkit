Market Maker toolkit based on Steve Mauro plan
Risk is 2%
Stop set 23 pips above high if first leg
Stop set 10 pips above high if second leg
If trailing, trail by 32 pips, otherwise hard SL and TP always set, TP = 50 pips

Some Rules:
0000-0800 Asian range less than 50 pips otherwise watch the last 1/3
0930-1600 London
1630-2400 NY
Traps occur beginning of week, day, and session, and the end of each as well
A trap is a pull away from the recent high/low to "trap" the traders who expect continuation
Gap times are the 30 mins before the opens, there are only 2 - 0300-0400 and 0900-1000 EST
ADR 200 for a day 600 for a week max
Look for ADR * 3 once the move begins
MA's: 5 13 50 200 800 mustard ketchup water mayo blueberry
Previous Day High/Low show on current
4HR chart HOW and LOW during first 8 hours
Out of asian range, watch for vector in opposite of main trend
Use shift bar to confirm
W V V M for uptrends
M A A W for downtrends
Pivots: (M's are halfway between pivots: S2 M1 S1 M2 CPP M3 R1 M4 R2)
M2 up to M4 is the up day
M3 down to M1 is the down day
Level 1 begins off of an M or W - MA's tighen
Level 2 extends, Market makers ignore and come back for level 3 - 50 MA crosses 200
Level 3 ends with a W or M and Head/Shoulders - MA's fan out
Gap/brinks trade occurs when the HOD or LOD is set during gap time
Safety trade is after level 1 consolidation
WAIT FOR TRADES AFTER THE SESSION BEGINS TO AVOID TRAP MOVES

/*	Position planning and management
Entry: rules for entering
	Determine level (1,2,3) and direction (up/down)
		MA spread helps with levels, 50 over 200 might mean level 2
	Find PFH or PFL and trade away from it (M or W of day or week)
	Look to counter traps in gap time (brinks trade when it is HOD or LOD)
	
Holding: rules while position is open
	Monitor ADR for week and day to determine range of the trade
	M2 to M4 pivots for up days (M3 to M1 for down)	
	
Exit: signs to close early, monitored while holding
	50 pips reached, or stop loss of 23 pips on single leg and 10 pips on double 
	(if trailing, move stops to break even at 32 pips)
	

How does homework play into these rules? The boxes still must be monitored, PFH and PFL as well
